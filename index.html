      <h2>Who are we?</h2>

      <p>

        We're a team of <strong>passionate students and alumni</strong> that
        are dedicated to improving the way student radio and computers
        interact.  As part of the UK's <strong>oldest legal independent radio
          station</strong>, we help some of the best student presenters,
        reporters, and producers make the most of their time at York by giving
        them the tools and resources they need to make damn good radio.
